# Console Examples
This repository holds a series of console application examples that I like to use for testing or as the basis for console apps.

# Different console examples
- ConsoleDependencyInjectionExp1 - Shows an example of doing dependency injection using the C# 9.0 [Top-level statements style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements)
- ConsoleDependencyInjectionUsingHostBuilderExp1 - Shows an example of using the HostApplicationBuilder to run your console app once (it does stop the host immediately after the math service runs)
